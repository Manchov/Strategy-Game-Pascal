# Castle Defense: A Strategic Computer Game in Lazarus written in Pascal

## Introduction
For my final high school computer class project, I created a strategic computer game titled "Castle Defense" using the Lazarus IDE. The game challenges players to defend their castle against waves of attacking spirits from four directions: north, east, south, and west. The goal is to employ strategic thinking and quick reactions to prevent the spirits from overtaking the castle.

## Game Description
"Castle Defense" is a single-player game where you control an archer stationed in the castle. Your task is to shoot arrows at incoming spirits to prevent them from reaching the castle. The game features two difficulty levels: Normal and Hard. The difficulty affects the resilience of the spirits and the strategy required to achieve a high score.

## How to Play/Run the Game

"Castle Defense" is easy to get started with. Follow these simple steps to launch and play the game on your Windows PC:

1. **Run the Game**: Locate the downloaded `.exe` file on your computer. Double-click the file to run the game. If you encounter a Windows security prompt, choose to run the file, as it is safe.

2. **Choose Difficulty**: Upon starting the game, you'll be prompted to select the difficulty level (Normal or Hard). Use your mouse to click on your choice.

3. **Game Controls**:
    - Use `W` to shoot arrows upwards (North).
    - Use `A` to shoot arrows to the left (West).
    - Use `S` to shoot arrows downwards (South).
    - Use `D` to shoot arrows to the right (East).
    - Press `Spacebar` to fire the arrow in the chosen direction.

4. **Upgrading Your Archer**: As you play, you'll earn gold that can be used to upgrade your archer's abilities, including arrow speed, damage, and the number of simultaneous arrows you can shoot. Access these upgrades directly within the game's interface.

5. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until your castle is overrun by spirits or you successfully fend off all waves. Aim for a high score by efficiently managing your resources and strategically defeating the spirits.

### System Requirements
To run "Castle Defense," you need a PC with:
- Windows 7 or later.
- At least 512 MB of RAM.
- Approximately 50 MB of free disk space.

Enjoy defending your castle against the spirits, and aim for the highest score!

## Design and Inspiration
The game's graphics are inspired by classic Nintendo games and Minecraft, featuring a pixel and retro look. All assets were personally designed using Paint.NET. The game's design incorporates various elements, such as spirits, arrows, and a castle, all created to fit the theme and challenge of the game.

## Technical Overview
Developed in the Lazarus IDE, "Castle Defense" comprises around 1700 lines of code and utilizes 61 components, including timers, images, buttons, and labels. The game implements basic Lazarus libraries to handle game mechanics, user input, and graphical updates.

## Development Experience
Creating this game allowed me to explore and expand my programming skills, particularly in game development and graphical user interface design. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, highlighting the potential of Lazarus for creating interactive applications.
